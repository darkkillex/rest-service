TO-DO:
- Create a Class(i.e. UtilityHandler) to manage global methods (like addMetricToRequest())
- Manage custom counter metric also when an Exception is triggered
- Move other global method (like checkObjectIsNotNull) in the UtilityHandler
- Check if ID increment only when POST is triggered
- Set up of :
    *Prometheus: Stores our metric data - NOT YET
    *Grafana: Visualizes our data in graphs - NOT YET
- Refactor MockCars.findById implement a fully functional approach (ref. "remove" operation)


Solved
- Set up of :
    *Micrometer:
        Exposes the metrics from the application - DONE;
        Implement a new metric: counter for each request done (POST, PUT, DELETE, UPDATE)
- Creation of unique IDs for car obj
- Replace "if controls" in CarHandler class with a useful method
- Control on a unique plate for POST and PUT operation as well.
- Implement filter methods with Stream filter()
